Dear Editor,

Would you be so kind as to review our paper for publication as a research article in your journal?

We think this manuscript should be well-suited to American Naturalist because you have a prominent history on the question how broader life history strategies of plants influence their reproductive investment. One strand of the history has been understanding the trade-off in the allocation of reproductive investment between pollen-attraction versus seed provisioning (Haig & Westoby 1988 Am Nat 131). The Haig-Westoby ideas have been extended and elaborated both by Burd 2008 (Am Nat 171) and in a series of papers by Rosenheim et al. (Rosenheim et al. 2014 Am Nat 184). The manuscript submitted here contributes in two ways. Empirically it provides the largest ever quantification of components of reproductive investment across a suite of co-occurring plant species. These results show in particular that accessory costs are really substantial, with consequences for how we should think about the evolutionary forces at play. On the ideas side, our manuscript extends the theory set forth by Burd and Rosenheim et al, to show how the trade-offs that underlie the division of energy between pollen-attraction versus provisioning materials link with other well-established trade-offs, including the seed size-seed number trade-off.

We note also that this article has not been previously reviewed, and that a preprint has been lodged with the non-commercial repository BioRxiv, under the CC-BY-NC license (as required in your instructions for authors).


To produce viable seeds, plant's allocate energy to a wide variety of other reproductive tissues; yet little is known about the magnitude of these costs for different species. We quantified variation in reproductive effort (RE) among different reproductive tissues for 14 perennial species in a recurrent-fire coastal heath community. Total accessory costs – the proportion of RE not directly invested in provisioning the seed – were found to be very large, varying from 95.8% to 99.8% across the study species. When comparing species, we found strong support for three evolutionary trade-offs that are predicted to arise when RE is divided into different tissue masses and counts across species: 1) between successful pollen-attraction costs and mature ovule count, 2) between total reproductive costs and seed count, and 3) between seedset and relative investment in pollen-attraction. The combination of these trade-offs leads to coordinated shifts in the amounts invested in floral construction, in seedset and seed size across species. While it is well-known that a species seed size positions in along a colonization-competition life-history spectrum; here we show that relative construction costs of pollen-attraction versus provisioning tissues and seedset are also part of this trajectory, thereby expanding our understanding of the relatives sizes of floral and fruiting structures observed across angiosperms.
