Whether the authors wish to be identified to the reviewers by listing author names on the title page.
whether the authors have agreed with the data sharing policy,
which associate editors seem most appropriate to handle the manuscript (see list here http://www.amnat.org/an/EdBd.html).


In the Comments field, please explain how this manuscript fits the goals of the journal or the specific section of the journal.

The American Naturalist aims to publish papers that

- are of interest to the broad readership,
- pose a new and significant problem or introduce a novel subject,
- change the way people think about the topic of the manuscript, and/or
- confirm or refute an unverified theoretical principle or a previously unsupported or weakly supported generalization.


Dear Editor,

Would you kindly review our paper for publication as a research article in your journal? We provide the largest ever quantification of reproductive investment for a suite of co-occurring plant species, and report how evolutionary pressures have caused species to invest in different reproductive tissues.

We have chosen to submit this manuscript to American Naturalist because of its long-history reporting how the broader life history strategies of plants influence their reproductive investment. One strand of this research, and a major focus of the current work, has been understanding the trade-off in the allocation of reproductive investment between pollen-attraction versus seed provisioning (Haig & Westoby 1988 Am Nat 131). This work was  extended upon both by Burd 2008 (Am Nat 171) and a series of papers by Rosenheim et al. (Rosenheim et al. 2014 Am Nat 184). The current manuscript extends the theory set forth in these previous papers, to show how the trade-offs that underlie the division of energy between pollen-attraction versus provisioning materials link with other well-established trade-offs, including the seed size-seed number trade-off.

We look forward to your review.
