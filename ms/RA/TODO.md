Need more extensive Supp Mat

Detail methods used to estimate growth of leaf and stem (link to main text)

Mark comments:
- in this particular succession, life history not correlated with other traits (LMA, seed, wood density) → but we don’t necessarily expect this to generalise
- add LMA to results table / discussion
- more on succession/ link to traits
- no phylogenetic correction (why)

Other discussion
- link to demography: leaf area, vs
- link to SG paper --   links to rate of pop turnover.
