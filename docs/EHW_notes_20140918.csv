"I realized there are a number of plants with ""errors"" - I assume this means they don't even generate error logs. I can't figure out what is wrong for any of these",,,,,,,,,,

Other questions:,,,,,,,,,,
PELA_903,"How does skipping progressions work for a species where each fruit size is calculated individually; can I skip progressions, as I do here, or not.",,,,,,,,,
"Lots of species have negative investment, often between flower parts that clearly get bigger in the correct order, so I can't figure out what is wrong.",,,,,,,,,,
For instance:,,,,,,,,,,
BAER_901,32,17,18,bud_big,bud_just_opening,-1.421,838,-1190.798,,
BOLE_008,7,5,6,flower_calyx,finished_flower,-0.212471939,352,-74.79012245,,"This should be OK; there are 4 finished flower stigmas + 1 finished flower that are derived from one flower_calyx, but this transition is always marked as negative"
,,,,,,,,,,
"I assume that some of the negative investments have to do with individual specific weights being used for some plant parts. In which case, although the trajectory is weird, the final numbers are accurate.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"Other than the few ""errors"" above, I now feel good about having solved all the problems with the error files, but still need to work through many of the investment and lost files; For each, I sort by total investment, and then look at the biggest and smallest numbers carefully hunting for errors.",,,,,,,,,,
