The third fruit, stayed the same size (15mm) until it became a seed, and therefore I didn't enter it again as a ""fruit_large_immature_04"", but the program assumes the 15 mm fruit at census 7 is the 15 mm fruit at census 6 and one of the small seeds doesn't progress. Should I continue entering the 15 mm fruit at each census to  not confuse the program?"

Is this because you have set fractions of carbon going to each of the tissue types (when a bud is split into the various flower parts)"
EPMI,,,,,,,,,no errors found
BOLE,,,,,,,,,"only problem is that flower_calyx weighs more than finished_flower + 4x-finished flower stigma; I think this is because some number has been typed into the program for carbon splitting, instead of using the current numbers in flower parts"
