The third fruit, stayed the same size (15mm) until it became a seed, and therefore I didn't enter it again as a ""fruit_large_immature_04"", but the program assumes the 15 mm fruit at census 7 is the 15 mm fruit at census 6 and one of the small seeds doesn't progress. Should I continue entering the 15 mm fruit at each census to  not confuse the program?"
