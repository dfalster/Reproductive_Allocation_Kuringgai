# file names

- leaf_counts is file with calculated leaf counts and leaf lifespan data
- SummarySppAge is file with means of LL - and other variables - by species and age; LMA data is merged to this file
- subsets of SummarySppAge are created to omit babies or HATE for various analyses

# What causes RA to shift with age in species?
Theoretical models indicate that there need to be size (or age) related shifts in *some* trade-off to create graded RA schedules.

For instance, shifts in a variable such as leaf lifespan, fecundity per RA, photosynthetic rates with size (or other variables) will change the RA schedule.

I have both RA schedules and lots of other data across multiple ages:
  - leaf lifespa
- LMA
- accessory tissue costs

# Shifts in RA with age

Showing just a few of the RA schedules from my last lab meeting.

They show that species differ greatly in RA, that there is a general increase with age, but also that the data are noisy.

# Individual shoots looked decidedly "less leafy" in many older plants
This led me to wonder how leaf lifespan - or some other variable - was shifting with age

The number of leaves along a leader is overall uneffected by age, although some species show a marked decline

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide', message=FALSE}
plot(lvs_end_total~age,SummaryInd,log="xy", xlab="age",ylab="final leaf count along shoot",col=col.spp[as.factor(species)])

```

# LMA versus age
The plot below is a bulked LMA sample from each site, of leaves from the second most recent cohort

There is a significant increase with age (p=0.002) and many species differ from one another, despite the very few points
Age is only borderline significant (p=0.04) when the seedlings are removed

# Leaf lifespan with age
Leaf lifespan increases from seedlings (1.4 yrs) to saplings (2.4 years) to adults (>4 years), but there are no differences between the different adult populations

# Had expected a stronger pattern either in leaf lifespan or leaf count on a shoot
Apparently it is simply that older plants have more stem - plotting total leaf weight against final weight, shows bigger plants have relatively fewer leaves
(Yes, I know the 2.4 yr olds are missing...)

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide', message=FALSE}
plot(total_leaf_weight~FinalWeight,SummaryInd, log="xy",col=col.age[as.factor(age)], pch=16, cex=0.8)
legend("bottomright",col=col.age, labels.age, pch=16, cex=1)
```
# Next steps?
As I begin to analyze RA patterns, think more specifically about the species that do show a distinct change with age in one of hte "leaf" parameters.

For instance, is there some way to capture "change with age" as a variabe of its own that is worth comparing across species.

Afterall, the energy allocation models suggest that different RA schedules may be due to different amounts of "shifting" across species - some species might be predicted to shift more than others.
